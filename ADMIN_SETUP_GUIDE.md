# Admin System Setup Guide

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive admin system for BabyBloom with the following features:

### ✅ What's Been Created

1. **Database Schema** (`admin_system_schema.sql`)
   - User profiles table with role management
   - Admin activities tracking
   - Dashboard statistics caching
   - Proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies

2. **Registration System** (Modified `register.tsx`)
   - Added admin/user toggle during registration
   - Updated to save user role in metadata

3. **Admin Dashboard** (Sky blue themed)
   - **Profile Tab**: Admin profile management and settings
   - **E-Commerce Tab**: Dashboard with stats, quick actions, and order management
   - **UI Tab**: Theme settings, UI components, and system configuration

4. **Authentication & Routing**
   - Modified main layout to detect admin users
   - Automatic routing to admin dashboard for admin users
   - Admin service for role management and activity logging

### 🎨 Design Features

- **Sky Blue Theme**: Consistent with your requirement
- **Modern UI**: Cards, gradients, and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Professional Look**: Clean, admin-focused interface

1. Start your app: `npm start`
2. Go to registration screen
